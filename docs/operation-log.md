## 2026-05-17 — T209 Live Codex-CLI Certification

Driver: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context, max effort) via Claude Code session.
Pre-state ratified by user: commit `658c94e TASK 219: clarify legacy telemetry noops`.
Slimference daemon: PID 9252, canonical path `~/.local/bin/slimference daemon`, disarmed preflight.

Safety contract:
- Claude Code session talks to `api.anthropic.com`; not in hosts-patch blast radius.
- User opens a second Terminal as emergency-disarm fallback before Phase 1.
- Any anomaly in `degraded_sessions`, `parse_failures`, or unexpected `hosts_active`/`api.anthropic.com` entry triggers immediate `slimference disable && slimference root-disarm`.
- No env vars, no `openai_base_url`, no system proxy. Codex-only hosts.

### Phase 0 — Baseline (read-only)

Executed 2026-05-17.

Verified:
- `which slimference` = `/Users/christopher/.local/bin/slimference`, v2.0.2.
- Daemon: PID 9252, command `/Users/christopher/.local/bin/slimference daemon` (canonical).
- `slimference status --preflight`:
  - CA installed=true, in_keychain=**false** (needs Phase 1)
  - Daemon running=true, health=true
  - Listener: `:443=false`, `:8443=false`, `:8990=true`
  - Network: hosts_active=false, entries=0
  - Apps: codex_cli=true, codex_desktop_app=true, claude_code=false (all detected on disk)
  - DoH chatgpt.com OK → 104.18.32.47
  - DoH api.openai.com OK → 162.159.140.245
- `/etc/hosts`: slimference marker block present BUT all entries commented out (legacy from prior root-arm with anthropic, now inert).
- Listener sockets: only `:8990` LISTEN; no `:443`/`:8443`.
- `which codex` = `/Users/christopher/.npm-global/bin/codex`, `codex-cli 0.130.0` (WSS-capable build).

Anomaly + fix:
- `~/.slimference/run/daemon.pid` contained stale PID **10251** (dead). True daemon PID is **9252** (confirmed via `~/.slimference/slimference.pid` JSON + lock holder).
- Root cause hypothesis: a second `slimference daemon` invocation around 15:44 (2 min after legit start) wrote its own getpid() into the plain-int PID file before failing on lock acquisition. `writePIDFile()` in `cmd/slimference/hosts_lifecycle.go:157` writes before the lock-bound listener confirms uniqueness — that ordering should be inverted in a follow-up task to prevent recurrence.
- Fix applied now: wrote `9252\n` to `~/.slimference/run/daemon.pid`, verified `kill -0 9252` succeeds.
- Impact if unfixed: `slimference enable`/`disable` SIGHUP routes via this file → would have ESRCH'd → daemon would not hot-reload (config still written, but SNI listener wouldn't start without daemon restart).

Baseline ratified. Ready for Phase 1 (CA Keychain trust) when user confirms safety-net Terminal is open.

### Phase 1 — Trust CA (interactive)

Pending user readiness.

## 2026-05-17 — PID Reload Drift Closed in Code

Commit: `14a3168 TASK 226: prepare scoped Codex WSS promotion`.

Correction to the Phase 0 anomaly note above:
- The immediate manual PID rewrite was only a temporary recovery.
- The durable fix is now in code: foreground/TUI proxy starts do not write
  `~/.slimference/run/daemon.pid`; only the managed daemon owns that file.
- `signalDaemonReload()` now self-heals: if the legacy reload PID is missing
  or stale, it falls back to the canonical daemon PID record in
  `~/.slimference/slimference.pid`.
- Daemon startup writes the reload PID only after the proxy listener is
  confirmed active, so failed second daemon starts cannot steal the reload
  target.
- Daemon-start tests stub the PID writer so local test runs cannot overwrite
  the user's real reload PID file.

Post-fix live verification:
- `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 300s` passed.
- `go vet ./...` passed.
- `go run ./scripts/ci` passed all 8 gates; aggregate coverage was 99.6%.
- `go run ./scripts/build --install` produced matching stripped 18M binaries at
  `./slimference` and `~/.local/bin/slimference`.
- Daemon restarted as PID `72425`.
- `~/.slimference/run/daemon.pid` and `~/.slimference/slimference.pid` both
  resolved to PID `72425`.
- `slimference status --preflight` no longer changes the reload PID.
- Live state remained disarmed: no hosts patch, no `:8443`, no `:443`, scoped
  Codex route disabled, Claude Code disabled.
